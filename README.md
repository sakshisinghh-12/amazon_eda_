# Amazon Sales Data Analysis

# Project Overview:
This project analyzes Amazon sales data to uncover key insights into order trends, revenue distribution, and customer behavior. We explore metrics like top-selling orders, order status distribution, and city-wise sales performance.

# Objective:
The main goals of this project are:

- Identify the top-selling products and cities by revenue.
 
- Analyze order trends based on order quantity and amount.
  
- Understand the order fulfillment types (Amazon vs Merchant).
  
- Explore the order status breakdown (Shipped, Delivered, Canceled).
  
- Gain insights into customer purchase behavior.

# Dataset:
The dataset contains sales records with the following key columns:

- Order ID, Date, Status (Shipped, Delivered, Canceled)

- Quantity (Qty) and Amount (Revenue)

- Shipping Details (City, State, Country, Postal Code)

- Fulfillment Type (Amazon or Merchant)

- Product Category & Style

- Sales Channel (Amazon.in, B2B, etc.)

# Key Findings:
- Top-selling orders: The highest-selling products contribute significantly to total revenue.

- Order Status: A large number of orders are shipped and delivered successfully, while some remain canceled.

- Sales Distribution: Revenue is concentrated in a few high-selling cities.

- Fulfillment Analysis: Amazon-fulfilled orders perform better than merchant-fulfilled ones.
